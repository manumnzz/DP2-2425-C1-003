This is a starter project.  It is intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enrolled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the 
University of Seville.  This project helps them start working on their new information system 
projects.

To get this project up and running, please follow the guideline in the theory/lab materials,

- **Booking Management**: Automated system to manage flight bookings, cancellations, and updates.
- **Crew Scheduling**: Assign crew members to flights and track availability.
- **Incident Tracking**: Interface for reporting, tracking, and resolving operational incidents.
- **Aircraft Maintenance**: Monitor and schedule necessary maintenance for aircraft, ensuring safety and readiness.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your system.
3. Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials.
4. Run the application using Maven or your preferred Java IDE.
5. Access the application via the provided URL.

## Additional Notes
- This is an internal system meant for managing logistics in the context of charter flights at airports.
- The project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
- Future updates may include integration with external systems, user role management, and advanced reporting features.
